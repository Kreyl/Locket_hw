Hardware for the Locket Project ([Russian description](https://ostranna.ru/gamedesign/locket), [English description](https://ostranna.ru/?lang=en))

Locket is the device for LARPs. It has stm32 microcontroller, 868 MHz radio, buttons, vibro, RGB led, beeper and accelerometer. It is placed in nice 3d-printed case. Locket may be used for rather complex gamedesign. It is powered by two AAA batteries. 

Repository contains pcb files, antenna information and case model. 

Locket has several hardware (and firmware) versions (we call them new lockets, old lockets and ancient lockets). 
Master is for old lockets and v5 branch is for new. 
Corresponding firmware project is here https://github.com/Kreyl/Locket_fw/.
